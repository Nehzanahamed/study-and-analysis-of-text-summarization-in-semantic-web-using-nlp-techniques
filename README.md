## Overview

This project processes an input text file by summarizing its content, extracting relationships between key entities, and visually representing the relationships in a graph format. The summary and relationships are built using NLP techniques with NLTK, and the visualization is handled by NetworkX and optionally Graphviz/Matplotlib for enhanced graphics.

## Features

- üìÑ Summarizes input text using NLP techniques.
- üîó Extracts key relationships between entities.
- üìä Constructs a graph-based representation of the summary.
- üõ†Ô∏è Uses NLTK and NetworkX for processing and visualization.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python üêç
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) - for natural language processing tasks like tokenization, summarization, and entity extraction.
  - **NetworkX** - for graph-based visualization of relationships.
  - **Matplotlib/Graphviz** (Optional) - for enhanced graph visualization.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your input text file inside the `data/` folder of the project directory.
   
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will process the text, summarize it, extract relationships, and generate a graph-based visualization of the key relationships.

## Project Workflow

1. **Text Processing** ‚Äì Cleans and tokenizes the input text for analysis.
2. **Summarization** ‚Äì Extracts key information from the text for a concise summary.
3. **Relationship Extraction** ‚Äì Identifies and extracts relationships between key entities in the text.
4. **Graph Construction** ‚Äì Visualizes the extracted relationships using NetworkX and Graphviz/Matplotlib.
